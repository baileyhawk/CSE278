Lab_02
These files solve each of the 6 questions from Lab 2.

q_1a - Allows the user to input integers for the length and width of a rectangle. Prints the perimeter and area of the rectangle from these values.
q_1b - Allows the user to input a double value for the radius of a circle. Prints the perimeter and area of the circle from this value.

q_2a - Prompts the user to enter strings for their username and password. If the entered strings exactly match the correct username and password, "Login success" is printed and        the program exits. If the entered values are incorrect, "Login failed" is printed and the user is prompted to enter the values again.
q_2b - Does the same as q_2a but does not check for correct capitalization of letters.

q_3a - Prompts the user to input integer values to be entered into an array until they are done. The length, maximum value, and minimum value of the array are calculated and          printed.
q_3b - Does the same as q_3a but also calculates and prints the median value of the array.
